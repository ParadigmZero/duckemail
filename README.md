# About

A Raycast (Spotlight replacement) extension for managing DuckDuckGo email protection accounts, and quickly generating sending addresses.

# Add a local extension, or develop


use `npm` or `pnpm`:

```
npm i
```

run dev:

```
npm run dev
```

This will install the local extension and watch for changes, but if you exit the process, the local extension will remain installed, just ignoring any further changes.
